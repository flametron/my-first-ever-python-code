# my-first-ever-python-code

So, a friend of mine, who was teaching me python had asked me to write my name with stars, and I had made this code to write any word with stars.  
Maybe not significant for others, but for me, this is the first Python code I wrote.

Warning: The code is for Python 2, which, is now deprecated.
